# Overview
```{r Load_the_Data, cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
setwd('~/Documents/Open_Course/UDACITY/Data Analysis with R/Final Project/')
loan <- tbl_df(read.csv('prosperLoanData.csv', header=T, stringsAsFactors=F))
```

### Browse Data
This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan.
```{r dim, echo=FALSE}
dim(loan)
```

Here are the names of all the 81 variables:
```{r var_names, echo=FALSE}
names(loan)
```

Let's take a glimpse of all the variables. Since I set `stringsAsFactor=FALSE` when load the data. All the varibles are either numeric or string for now. But to make more sense of the analysis, I may change the class of some variables later.
```{r summary, echo=FALSE}
str(loan)
```

------

## Exploratory Univariate Analysis
There's a borrower behind every loan, I'll start with exploring some variables of the characteristics of the borrowers.  

```{r Data Cleaning First Stage, cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
loan$IncomeRange <- factor(loan$IncomeRange, 
                           levels=c("Not employed", "$0", "$1-24,999", "$25,000-49,999", 
                                    "$50,000-74,999", "$75,000-99,999", "$100,000+", 
                                    "Not displayed"))

loan$ProsperRating..Alpha. <- loan$ProsperRating..Alpha. %>%
    factor(levels = c("AA", "A", "B", "C", "D", "E","HR")) %>%
    addNA(ifany=T)

loan$ListingCreationDate <- ymd_hms(loan$ListingCreationDate)
loan$IsBorrowerHomeowner <- factor(loan$IsBorrowerHomeowner)
```

**First, let's find out how much they earn annually.**  
```{r IncomeRange, cache=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(aes(x=IncomeRange), data=loan) + 
    geom_bar(binwidth = 500, fill=c('#068EDB', rep('#05DBF2', 6), '#068EDB')) +
    stat_bin(geom="text", binwidth = 500, aes(label=..count.., vjust=-0.5, hjust=0.5)) +
    ylim(0, 35000) + 
    theme(axis.text.x  = element_text(angle=90, vjust=0.5)) + 
    labs(title='The Income Range of the Borrowers')
```

Most borrowers' income ranges from \$25,000 - \$74,999. To my surprise, there are 621 borrowers with zero income successfully got the loan. Although it's not clearly stated in the dataset, I guess here 'the income' means the income from employment rather than from all sources. Maybe exploring more information about those borrowers would make it clearer that why they can get the loan.

------

**When browse the website of 'Prosper' as a prospective lender, a feature - high 'Prosper Rating' (usually 'AA' or 'A') - of all listings in 'Featured Loan Listings' caught my eyes, which makes me curious about how are the 'Prosper Ratings' of the borrowers in this dataset.**

```{r Prosper Rating, cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x=ProsperRating..Alpha.), data=loan) + 
    geom_bar(binwidth = 500, fill=c(rep('#05DBF2', 7), '#068EDB')) +
    stat_bin(geom="text", binwidth = 500,
             aes(label=..count.., vjust=-0.5, hjust=0.5)) +
    ylim(c(0, 31000)) + 
    labs(title='Prosper Ratings of the Borrowers')
```

Except for `NA`s, the distribution of the ordinal variable has a bell-like shape. 'C' is the most frequent rating in our data and the highest (AA) and the lowest (HR) rating are less common comparing with other ratings in between. I was surprised to see so many missing values. But Prosper Rating only applicable for loans originated after July 2009. So taking a glimpse of the when were the listings created maybe a reasonable thing to do next.

```{r ListingCreationDate, cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
table(loan$ListingCreationDate < ymd("2009-07-01"),dnn = "Prior to 07/01/09")
range(loan$ListingCreationDate)
```

The number of listings prior to 2009-07-01 is 29084, which is exactly the same with the number of missing values in Prosper Rating variable. And the earliest listing was created at `r min(loan$ListingCreationDate)` and the latest one was at `r max(loan$ListingCreationDate)`.

------

**Another thing I found in 'Featured Loan Listings' on the website was all listings there were of 3-year long. Let's see if 3-year is really the most popular choice in terms of the length of the loans.**

```{r Term, cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
table(as.numeric(loan$Term)/12)
table(loan$Term/12)/length(loan$Term)
loan$Term <- factor(loan$Term) #For later Analysis
```

There're only three options for the length of the loan - 1 year, 3 years and 5 years. Only about 1.4% of the borrowers chose 1 year and 21.5% chose 5 years. With 77% of people chose 3 years, it surely is the most popular choice.
**Let's take a look at which part of the country the borrowers live.**  
```{r BorrowerState, cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
loan$BorrowerAPR <- factor(loan$BorrowerAPR)
loan$BorrowerState <- factor(loan$BorrowerState)
```

```{r Table of BorrowerState, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
bos <- loan %>% #[bo]rrowers' states
    group_by(BorrowerState) %>%
    summarise(n = n()) %>% 
    arrange(desc(n))
kable(bos, col.names = c("State", "Number of borrowers"), align = rep('c',2))
```

The number of borrowers of different states varies a lot. While it's hard to take all the states into consideration and especially to visualize the result all together, I will choose CA, TX and NY, the three states with largest amount of borrowers, as representatives for the later geographical analysis.

------

**I started my first job around half year age and the idea of borrowing a loan has never come to me. So I'm curious about when does a person get a loan in terms of the years one has been working.**  

```{r EmploymentStatusDuration, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
ggplot(aes(x=EmploymentStatusDuration/12), 
       data=subset(loan, EmploymentStatus %in% 
                       c("Employed", "Full-time", "Part-time", "Self-employed"))) + 
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill='#05DBF2', color='black') +
    labs(title='Length of Employment', x='years of employment') +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0, 63, 2))
```


I subset the borrowers with employment status listed as "Employed", "Full-time", "Part-time" and "Self-employed" and draw a histogram of the length of employment for them. 
I'm also curious about purpose of the personal loans. Using year as the unit of time, there is a very clear descending trend of the number of people who borrow loans with the increase of the length of employment. My guess is the longer one works, the more one earns and the more one saves. With more saving in the bank, people are less likely to borrow loans.

------

**Next, let's take a look at the distribution of the percentage of a consumer's monthly gross income that goes toward paying debts. **  

```{r DebtToIncomeRatio summary, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
summary(loan$DebtToIncomeRatio)
```

I see a huge gap between the 3rd quartile and the maximum and a simple calculation tells me they are `r round(max(loan$DebtToIncomeRatio, na.rm=T)/quantile(loan$DebtToIncomeRatio, 0.75, na.rm=T))` times away! Let's draw the histogram to get a better understanding of DIT(Debt to Income) Ratio.

```{r DebtToIncomeRatio hist all, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x=DebtToIncomeRatio), data=loan) + 
    geom_histogram(fill='#05DBF2', color='black') +
    labs(title=expression(paste("Debt to Income Ratio")), 
         x='Debt / Income')
quantile(loan$DebtToIncomeRatio, 0.99, na.rm=T)
```

```{r DebtToIncomeRatio hist limited, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x=DebtToIncomeRatio), 
       data=subset(loan,DebtToIncomeRatio<=1)) + 
    geom_histogram(binwidth=0.01, fill='#05DBF2', color='black') +
    labs(title=expression(paste("Debt to Income Ratio (for ",DTI <= 1,")")), 
         x='Debt / Income')
```

After limiting the ratio to less or equal to 1, we include more than $99\%$ of the data but get a much finer graphic. The distribution has a bell shape and is right-skewed. And if we call the function `quantile(loan$DebtToIncomeRatio, 0.95, na.rm=T)`, it tells us $95\%$ of the borrowers keep their DTI $\leq 1$. Of course, besides paying the debt people get life to live and it requires money.

------

**Let's see what do people borrow money for.**  

```{r Category, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
loan$Category <- factor(loan$ListingCategory..numeric., 
                        levels=c(1:6,8:20,7,0),
                        labels=c('Debt Consolidation',
                                'Home Improvement', 'Business', 'Personal Loan',
                                'Student Use', 'Auto', 'Baby&Adoption',
                                'Boat', 'Cosmetic Procedure', 'Engagement Ring',
                                'Green Loans', 'Household Expenses', 
                                'Large Purchases', 'Medical/Dental',
                                'Motorcycle', 'RV', 'Taxes', 'Vacation',
                                'Wedding Loans', 'Other', 'Not Available'))
loan$ListingCategory..numeric. <- factor(loan$ListingCategory..numeric.) #For later use
ggplot(aes(x=Category), data=loan) + 
    geom_bar(binwidth = 500, fill='#05DBF2') +
    stat_bin(geom="text", binwidth = 500, size = 3,
             aes(label=..count.., vjust=-0.5, hjust=0.5)) +
    ylim(c(0, 63000)) + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, vjust=0.5)) +
    labs(title='The Purpose of the Loans')
```

Majority of people get the personal loans for debt consolidation. Home improvement and Business are also important purpose for the loans. Another thing I find very interesting is that about the same amount of people get the loan for student use, Vacation and Wedding. It seems like that education, preparation for getting married and getaway from home are all equally worth investing.  

------

**I want to know if one needs recommendations to successfully receive the loan.**
```{r Recommendations, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x=Recommendations), data=loan) + 
    geom_histogram(binwidth=1, fill='#05DBF2', color='black') +
    labs(title="Number of Recommendations of the Borrowers")

table(loan$Recommendations != 0, dnn = "If the borrower has one or more recommendations")
```

Majority of borrowers didn't have a recommendation at all. 

------

**Prosper is a peer-to-peer lending business. After learning a few things about the borrowers, I decide to explore some lenders related variables to see how the lenders benefit from investing in loans.**  

```{r LenderYield, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
summary(loan$LenderYield)
ggplot(aes(x=LenderYield), data=loan) + 
    geom_histogram(binwidth=0.005, fill='#05DBF2', color='black') +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0, 0.5, 0.05)) + 
    labs(title="The Lender Yield on the Loan")

```

There are `r sum(loan$LenderYield <= 0)` cases that the lenders didn't get any profit and even lost some of their own money. But `r sum(loan$LenderYield <= 0)` out of `r nrow(loan)`, the odd is really low. Most yields range from 0.05 to 0.35. Surprisingly, the highest peak in the graphic is around 0.31, which shows a really rosy picture if one considers about doing the similar investment.

------

**How many lenders usually 'share' the risk the loan together?**

```{r Investors, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
summary(loan$Investors)
table(loan$Investors==1, dnn = "Only one investor")
ggplot(aes(x=Investors), data=subset(loan, Investors>1)) + 
    geom_histogram(binwidth=10, fill='#05DBF2', color='black') +
    labs(title="The Number of Investors Funded the Loan\n (for loans with more than one investors)")
```

About 24.4% of loans only has one investor. For the rest of listings, with multiple investors,   

------

## Exploratory Bivariate Analysis

With 24.4% of loans only has one investor, I want to know if the only lender is usually a friend of the borrower?

```{r InvestmentFromFriendsCount, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
with(subset(loan, Investors==1), 
     table(InvestmentFromFriendsCount, 
           dnn = "if the single investor is a friend of the borrower"))
```

```{r ggpiars, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Sample 200 listings from the dataset for a quicker but may be not very precise 
# overview of pair-wise relations with ggpairs function
loan.s <- sample_n(loan, 200) #[loan] [s]ample
ggpairs(loan.s[,c("IncomeRange", "IsBorrowerHomeowner", 
                  "EmploymentStatusDuration", "DebtToIncomeRatio")],
        diag=list(continuous="density", discrete="bar"), axisLabels="none")

ggpairs(loan.s[,c("LenderYield","ProsperRating..Alpha.","Term",
                 "Recommendations", "Investors")],
        diag=list(continuous="density", discrete="bar"), axisLabels="none")
```

Does Higher Risk Really Mean Higher Return?
```{r prosper rate vs yield, cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x=ProsperRating..Alpha., y=LenderYield), data=loan) +
    geom_boxplot(aes(fill = ProsperRating..Alpha.)) +
    guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "ProsperRating"))

with(loan, by(LenderYield, ProsperRating..Alpha., summary))
```

I create a new variable here called `YearsSinceFirstCreditLine`, which show the duration from the time of `FirstRecordedCreditLine` to the date the dataset last updated (03/01/2014) for each borrower. **I want to know if person with longer history of credit record has higher `ProsperRating`.**

```{r prosper rate vs first credit line, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
loan$FirstRecordedCreditLine <- ymd_hms(loan$FirstRecordedCreditLine)
cut.date <- mdy("03/11/2014")
loan$YearsSinceFirstCreditLine <- as.numeric((cut.date -loan$FirstRecordedCreditLine)/365)
ggplot(aes(x=YearsSinceFirstCreditLine), data=loan) +
    geom_density(aes(color = ProsperRating..Alpha., fill = ProsperRating..Alpha.), 
                 alpha = 0.5) +
    facet_wrap(~ProsperRating..Alpha., ncol=2)
```

For Credit Score, average age of open credit lines is a key credit-influencing factors. So I was expecting to see the similar effects of `FirstRecordedCreditLine`(The date the first credit line was opened) on `ProsperRating`. To my surprise, the length of time since the borrower opened the first credit line makes no difference on the what `ProsperRating` he/she can get. The conditional distributions of `FirstRecordedCreditLine` are almost identical one another.

------

If `FirstRecordedCreditLine` is not a key factor of `ProsperRating`, let's take California, Texas and New York as examples to see if there is a geographic difference of `ProsperRating` among the three states.

```{r prosper rate in different states, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
loan_3_states <- loan %>%
    filter(BorrowerState %in% c("CA", "TX", "NY")) %>%
    mutate(BorrowerState = factor(BorrowerState, levels=c("CA", "TX", "NY")))
ggplot(aes(x=BorrowerState, fill = ProsperRating..Alpha.), 
       data=filter(loan_3_states, !is.na(as.character(ProsperRating..Alpha.)))) +
    geom_bar(position="fill") +
    guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "ProsperRating")) +
    ylab(label = "Percentage")

PR_State_table <- with(loan_3_states, 
                       by(as.character(ProsperRating..Alpha.), BorrowerState, 
                          table, useNA="no"))
print("The Percentage of Prosper Rates in California")
prop.table(PR_State_table$CA)
print("The Percentage of Prosper Rates in Texas")
prop.table(PR_State_table$TX)
print("The Percentage of Prosper Rates in New York")
prop.table(PR_State_table$NY)
```

From the stacked bar chart and the following percentage information in detail, there is no significant difference of `ProsperRating` of borrowers live in CA, TX and NY. But a statistical test would help us understand to difference (if there is any) better.

```{r IncomeRange vs ProsperRating, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x=IncomeRange, fill = ProsperRating..Alpha.), 
       data=filter(loan, !is.na(as.character(ProsperRating..Alpha.)))) +
    geom_bar(position="fill") +
    theme(axis.text.x  = element_text(angle=45, vjust=0.5)) + 
    guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "Prosper Rate")) +
    ylab(label = "Percentage") + 
    ggtitle("Prosper Rate for Borrowers with Different Income Range")

loan$IncomeRange_re <- factor(loan$IncomeRange, 
                           levels=c("$0", "Not employed", "$1-24,999", "$25,000-49,999", 
                                    "$50,000-74,999", "$75,000-99,999", "$100,000+", 
                                    "Not displayed"))

ggplot(aes(x=IncomeRange_re, fill = ProsperRating..Alpha.), 
       data=filter(loan, !is.na(as.character(ProsperRating..Alpha.)))) +
    geom_bar(position="fill") +
    theme(axis.text.x  = element_text(angle=45, vjust=0.5)) + 
    guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "Prosper Rate")) +
    ylab(label = "Percentage") + 
    ggtitle("Prosper Rate for Borrowers with Different Income Range (Reordered)")
```

If we change the order of "Not employed" and "$0", a very interesting step-wise graphic shows up. We can claim that Borrowers of higher income range tend to have better Prosper Rate, however, borrowers who were not employed when they send out the loan request have higher Prosper Rate than those who had zero income.

q1 + annotation_custom(my_grob)
```

### Description One
Just as we have seen in the previous section, higher risk is usually associated with higher return. Also, although most borrowers keep their debt to income ratio low, but those with worse Prosper Rating are more likely to put higher debt to income ratio listing up. That's why we see an upper triangular shape with the cluster of most points.

### Description Two
I really want to add an interactive graphics into the final analysis part, so I chose `rMaps` package to visualize the number of listings created in each state (first map). California, Texas, New York and Florida are the top 4 on the list of state with big borrower market. Meanwhile, I found a map(second map) shows the states are open to the investors on the Prosper website. I was wondering if whether a state opens to the investors relates to the size of borrower market, so I put the online map into the analysis for comparison. However, I didn't see a clear relation between those two maps. The fact that California, Texas, New York and Florida -- the four states with biggest borrower market -- are also the top 4 states with largest population makes me thinking if the listing to population ratio tells a different story to the absolute number of the listings. So I pulled the data of estimated population of each state for July 2014 from Wikipedia and then got a new graphic (the third map). Comparing the map of listing to population ratio to the one shows whether a state opens to the investors, it seems that those states are open to investors usually have higher listing to population ratio than those that don't.

### Plot Three
```{r Plot_Three, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 12}
loan <- loan %>% 
    mutate(ListingCreationYear = year(ListingCreationDate)) 

by_state_year <- loan %>%
    group_by(BorrowerState, ListingCreationYear)

listing_num <- by_state_year %>%
    summarise(count = n()) %>%
    filter(as.character(BorrowerState) != "")

q.plot1 <- ggplot(aes(x=ListingCreationYear, y=count), 
             data=filter(listing_num, ListingCreationYear!=2014)) +
    geom_line(color = "#F41D93") + 
    geom_point() + 
    labs(x="Creation Year", y="Number of Listings", 
         title="The Listings Created from 2006 to 2013 by State") + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, vjust=0.5)) + 
    facet_wrap(~ BorrowerState, ncol=6, scales = "free_y")


q.plot2 <- ggplot(aes(x=factor(ListingCreationYear)), 
                  data=filter(loan, ListingCreationYear > 2005, ListingCreationYear < 2014)) + 
    geom_bar(fill="#05DBF2") +
    stat_bin(geom="text", binwidth = 500, aes(label=..count.., vjust=-0.5, hjust=0.5)) + 
    ylim(c(0, 38000)) + 
    labs(x="Creation Year", y="Number of Listings", title="Total Number of Listings Created")

q.plots <- list(q.plot1, q.plot2)
layout <- matrix(c(rep(1,6), rep(2,3)), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)
multiplot(plotlist = q.plots, layout = layout)
```

### Description Three
The numbers of listing of each state showed in the Section of "Plot(s) Two" are the cumulative numbers since the business of Prosper started. But whether the business of Prosper has been growing year by year is also of my interest. From 2006 to 2007, the number of listings created almost doubled. But the number dropped a little in the year of 2008 and decreased dramatically in the following year - 2009. My guess is that the global financial crisis was the principal culprit. After 2009, the business started to recover steadily and by the year of 2011 the business got back to the size before the global financial crisis in terms of the number of listings created per year. And the following 2012 and 2013, the business bloomed really well.  

Seeing from the small multiples, the trend of the listings created each year of most states are similar to the overall trend as I explained in the last paragraph. Interestingly, it seems that the borrower markets were shut down completely after 2008 in Iowa, Maine and North Dakota in despite of the growing trend of listings created from 2006 to 2008. Also, the borrower market didn't start until 2007 in District of Columbia, 2008 in Nevada and Rhode Island and 2009 for South Dakota.

# Reflection
Using ggplot, rMaps and some other packages makes R such a powerful visualization tool. While it's easy to get a graphic of any kind, it's not easy to get a good and informative graphic with reasonable type, scale, legend etc.  

Since I have never been a borrower or a investor of a loan, I spend a lot of time just to understand the meaning of all the variables in the list of 81. But the good thing about the Prosper dataset is I was able to find detailed information for both the borrower side and the lender side from their website. With better understanding of how Prosper works, I ever start to think about being an investor in the future when I have extra money. I guess that is also the biggest takeaway for me for doing the project, because I'm now armed with the knowledge and confidence to explore data, even for those in some fields that I don't quite familiar with.

To achieve the perfect looking I was after, I changed the `ichoropleth` function in `rMaps` package a little bit and defined a customized version `ichoropleth.o`. I was really excited that I understood the drill of the function and was able to customize it to meet my own expectation.  

For further enriching the analysis, I would like a build a regression model using the available variables to predict the Prosper Rating for the future borrowers. As the models of credit score are the core of the Credit Score Companies and how big the business is for those companies, I want to explore myself using the great tool I learned in this course.

One last thing I want to mention but doesn't really show up in this analysis part is that when I pulled the population by state data from Wikipedia, google spreadsheet helped a lot! `IMPORTHTML` gives people an elegant and easy way to export tables and/or list from the webpage.
