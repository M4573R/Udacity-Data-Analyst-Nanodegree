This is my first project (out of five) of Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree. In this project, I work on the NYC Subway data to draw an interesting conclusion about the dataset itself and especially to figure out if more people ride the subway when it is raining versus when it is not raining.

Data Science Skills Applied:

 - Data wrangling
