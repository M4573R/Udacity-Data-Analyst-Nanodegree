###<font color='#068EDB'>Project Overview</font>
This the fourth project of [Nanodegree of Data Analyst of Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/nd002). It's for the course Intro to Machine Learning and you can find the related code and dataset [here on github](https://github.com/lmf90409/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/tree/master/P4).  

In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud. In the resulting Federal investigation, there was a significant amount of typically confidential information entered into public record, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data for top executives.  
In this project, I tried four supervised methods -- **Gaussian Naive Bayes**, **Random Forest**, **Logistic Regression** and **Support Vector Classifier** -- to detect person of interest (POI) in the fraud case. POIs are individuals who were indicted, reached a settlement, or plea deal with the government, or testified in exchange for prosecution immunity based on financial and email data made public as a result of the Enron scandal.
