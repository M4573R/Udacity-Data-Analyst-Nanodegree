#Data Analyst Nanodegress Projects - Udacity
I enrolled in the \#1 cohort of Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program in November 2014, which consists of five courses 
and five corresponding projects: 
Intro to Data Science, Data Wrangling with MongoDB, Data Analysis with R, Intro to Machine Learning and
Data Visualization and D3.js.  
Here're the final projects of each courses and some small open questions 
that I interested and would like to share along the way.
